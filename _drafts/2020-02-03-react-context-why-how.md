  Why and how to use React context with detailed code examples

Now that React context has become more established in the community we are seeing a lot of great usages of it. Reflecting on a previous post about [Higher-order components (HOC) vs Render props](/coding/hoc-vs-render-props-react), I rarely use HOC and generally deciding between Context or Render props. With the introduction of hooks and in particular `useContext` hook, React context is more accessible and has become a go to approach to solving complex state management. However, there are other options to handle these cross cutting concerns and so we should be clear on why we are using context. Let's explore why and how to use React context.

## Why React context

The React docs have an in-depth post covering all aspects of [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}, but I will provide a summary of it and how to use it.

What is the purpose of React context?

> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

For example you might have a container component responsible for fetching user data that is consumed by several components further down the component tree. If you were building a profile page to show an avatar there might be a navbar containing a dropdown which has an image element for the avatar. Further down the page there is a profile wrapper and inside that a header component to render the avatar. The intermediate components don't use the data, `NavBar`, `Dropdown` and `ProfileWrapper`, only pass the data along.

### Passing data via props is a poor approach because:

- Exposing data to components that don't need to know about it
- It's repetitive code and makes the component props more verbose
- Difficult and frustrating developer experience to follow the flow of data, especially in a large and complex component tree

### React context removes these issues by:

- Explicitly declaring the use of context and therefore handling which components have access to that data
- Less repetitive and not polluting the component props
- Using context makes it clear where the data is defined

Using context to manage data flow in a complex component tree can help make code easier to rationalise.

### Areas you might use React context

- Site settings/preferences for a user
- Styling themes, make it easy to change switch between light/dark theme
- User details, hide/show user views depending if they are logged in
- E-commerce basket management, showing items added to a basket when searching and adding items 

The above are typically **global** to the application however, it does not mean context should be used only for global features. It can be used further down the component tree to manage state of a complex feature. For example, multiple step form and depending on the answers determines the next questions to show.

### More options 

It does sound like React context can be used for anything however, there are other options for cross cutting concerns which maybe preferred. It would be excessive for handling local state with a component tree of two or three levels. For the same principle of keeping code easy to reason about here are other approaches. To handle state for a basic form you can use the [Render props](/coding/understanding-render-props-react-js) approach, like the popular form library [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}. When two components share the same state you can use [lifting state up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"} as an option.

## How to use it?

I wrote a post in November covering [manage complex state with React useReducer and useContext](/coding/react-hooks-usereducer-usecontext). This is where I first mention Context and it comes with a **todo app coding example** on CodeSandbox. I've decided to fork that sandbox and refactor it to have a better _todo API_ in React context.

### Lets begin

React context is made of two parts a **Provider** and a **Consumer**. The provider is where the **values** are defined that the consumer can access. Following the good practice of _encapsulation_ we won't expose the actual React provider but a wrapping component which will define the values. This simplifies the usage of `ToDosContext` and expose essential parts of the API to be used. Below is a code example show this:

```jsx
// todo-context.js
const TodosContext = React.createContext();

export function TodoProvider({ children }) {
  const [todoList, dispatch] = useReducer(toDoReducer, initialState);
  return (
    <TodosContext.Provider value={ { todoList, dispatch } }>
      {children}
    </TodosContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Following the same method of abstraction lets not expose the `dispatch` function but instead provide the methods to manage the tasks, `add`, `remove` and `mark`.

```jsx
// todo-context.js
// ...
export function TodoProvider({ children }) {
  const [todoList, dispatch] = useReducer(toDoReducer, initialState);
  const actions = {
    add(text) {
      dispatch(addAction(text));
    },
    mark(taskId, done) {
      dispatch(markAction(taskId, done));
    },
    remove(taskId) {
      dispatch(deleteAction(taskId));
    }
  };
  return (
    <TodosContext.Provider value={ { todoList, actions } }>
      {children}
    </TodosContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

From `todo-context.js` we can also export the **consumer** like so:

```javascript
export const TodosConsumer = TodosContext.Consumer;
```

Also export the main `TodosContext` on default:

```javascript
export default TodosContext;
```

Lets look at how to access and use the `add` action in the todo context. One option is to use the React hook `useContext`. This hook takes the `ToDosContext` and can access the actions, which I destruct out. The `add` action is called in the `handleSubmit` function to add a new task. See snippet below:

```javascript
// input-task.js
// InputTask ...
const [task, setTask] = useState("");
const {
  actions: { add }
} = useContext(TodosContext);

function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  add(task);
  setTask("");
}
// ...
```

Another way to access the context is to use the consumer component. In the `TaskList` component I use the `TodosConsumer` to read the `todoList` array. This uses the [Render props pattern](/coding/understanding-render-props-react-js) to access the context via the `children` prop as a callback function.

```jsx
// task-list.js
export function TaskList() {
  return (
    <TodosConsumer>
      {({ todoList }) => (
        <ol className="task-list">
          {todoList.map((task, i) => {
            return (
              <li className="task-item" key={i}>
               {/* ... */}
              </li>
            );
          })}
        </ol>
      )}
    </TodosConsumer>
  );
}
```

Another option to control access to the consumer is to create a custom React hook using `useContext`, wrap some error logic like expect provider to be present. See code example below:

```javascript
export function useToDo(){
  const context = React.useContext(TodosContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useToDo must be used within a TodoProvider')
  }

  return context
}
```
