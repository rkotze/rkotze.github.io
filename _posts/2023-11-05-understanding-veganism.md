With Veganism represented by a small group of people in the world I think it would be good to explain the position and help everyone become more understanding of a vegan's outlook.

So much [suffering and death in farming animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko) it can't be considered [humane](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humane). [Hundred of millions of animals **killed per day**](https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-get-slaughtered-every-day). [Animals killed for meat every year](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat)

Huge amounts of resources like water, crops, land, antibiotics and more go into keeping farm animals alive instead of humans directly consuming those essential resources. This is a very wasteful way to produce food. See [global land use for food production](https://ourworldindata.org/global-land-for-agriculture). 

Animal agriculture is the leading cause of [deforestation](https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation) creating a massive negative impact on our environment.

IMO, the best thing we can do is to go **Vegan**. Veganism is to achieve the goal of [abolishing animal exploitation](https://www.abolitionistapproach.com/about/).
