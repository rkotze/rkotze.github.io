I’m a Team Principal Engineer and mostly into JavaScript and Elixir. Besides JavaScripts flaws, I enjoy writing it because it gives plenty of freedom in how a solution can be designed. This can enable an engineer to construct a solution that clearly fits together, making it a very powerful tool. For similar reasons I like Elixir.

I'm an advocate for following <abbr title="Extreme Programming">XP</abbr> practices and Agile software development. <abbr title="Test-driven development">TDD</abbr> is a great tool to improve quality, prevent regression and help solve complex problems.

I also have my own and contribute to open source projects, see my [GitHub account](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"} to find out more.

I've built a hybrid mobile app using the Ionic framework and Cordova. Ionic has dealt with a lot of the UI pains to make it feel native and it is a pleasure to use. Android mobile app for using [London underground](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.oysterbalance749927){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"} and you can read more about [London Traveller](/projects/building-london-traveller-app)

Even though I don't actually design the UI for web apps I do enjoy participating in the UI development, to help gain an understanding of how a user might interact with the app. I believe it's important to deliver a quality user experience and ensure it is aesthetically pleasing.
