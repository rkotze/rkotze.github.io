This is my software engineering blog and I try to post every _Monday morning_ (but sometimes that does not happen). I write these posts because I think it's important to share knowledge and it helps me understand better what I have learned. 

I maintain my open source projects and contribute to others, see my [GitHub account](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"} to find out more.

I'm an advocate for following <abbr title="Extreme Programming">[XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}</abbr> practices and Agile software development. <abbr title="Test-driven development">TDD</abbr> is a great tool to improve quality, prevent regression and help solve complex problems.

Pair programming is important for building quality software efficiently in a team. It achieves shared knowledge among team, improved quality and helps toward a predictable delivery pace. Some developers might be concerned they are not getting attribution on commits and I've created [Git Mob](/projects/co-author-commits-with-git-mob) to help manage co-authors for commits.

Even though I don't actually design the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> for web applications any more I do enjoy participating in the <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> development, to help gain insight how a user might interact with the app. I believe it's important to deliver a quality user experience and it is aesthetically pleasing.
